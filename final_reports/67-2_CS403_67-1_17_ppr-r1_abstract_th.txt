     Cooperative education allows students to gain real-world work experience, and its popularity is growing among university students. However, each university manages its cooperative education process differently, which often leads to issues. From the developerâ€™s experience, common problems include document errors from students, inefficiencies in administrative review, and challenges in student selection by faculty members resulting in delays and extra work.
     To solve these issues, the developer created an application using Google Workspace tools such as AppSheet, Google Sheets, and Apps Script. 
The system supports key processes including student registration, document verification, student selection, result announcement, confirmation of acceptance, and company registration. It assigns roles based on user types and includes access controls to ensure data security.
     The system was tested with real users, and results showed improved accuracy in student data, reduced errors, and more efficient workflows making the overall cooperative education process smoother and more effective.
